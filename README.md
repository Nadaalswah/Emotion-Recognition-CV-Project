# Emotion-Recognition ðŸ˜Œ

Welcome to our Emotion Recognition project! This project was developed as part of our Computer Vision course, where we explored various pre-trained models for face detection and emotion recognition. Below you will find details about the models we used, how to run the project, and additional resources.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a system that can detect faces in images and recognize the emotions expressed by those faces. We experimented with multiple pre-trained models for both face detection and emotion recognition to find the most effective combination.
Models Explored

## For face detection and emotion recognition, we explored the following models:

    Face Detection Models:
        OpenCV Haar Cascade
        MTCNN
        RetinaFace

    Emotion Recognition Models:
        DeepFace (VGG16)
        HSEmotion

## Final Model Selection
After thorough evaluation, we selected RetinaFace for face detection due to its high accuracy and robustness. For emotion recognition, we used the HSEmotion model.


##Project Deployment
We have deployed our final model on Hugging Face. You can access and interact with the deployed model using the following link: https://huggingface.co/spaces/MohamedMotaz/EmotionRecognition
